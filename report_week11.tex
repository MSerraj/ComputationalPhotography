\title{Continuous Image Super-Resolution: Work of the Week}
\author{Martin Catheland}

\maketitle

This week, we implemented a Multi-Image LIIF-style approach using SIREN networks to learn representations that generalize to unseen images.

\section{Implementation Progress}

We developed a conditioned SIREN network that processes both coordinates and local patch information. The key innovations include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item SIREN architecture with sine activation layers
    \item Patch-based conditioning with center pixel removal
    \item Multi-image training pipeline using concatenated datasets
\end{itemize}

The model can now train on multiple images simultaneously and reconstruct both seen and unseen test images.

\section{Next Steps}

Our next objectives are to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scale up training with more images
    \item Test various patch sizes and architectures
    \item Implement super-resolution with downsampled patches
    \item Optimize for larger datasets
\end{itemize}
